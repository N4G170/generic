-> v0.05
    Influence wars added

-> V0.04
    A* Map demo added
    Imported and adapted my a* implementation
-> V0.03.1
    (Solar System demo)
        Added elliptical orbit with higher difference between minor and major axis, as well as its own rotation (much like earths orbit, it moves).
        Added another planet (earth like orbit) with a natural satellite. The satellite positioning is suffering from float int cast errors, in relation to its planet position.
-> V0.03
    Solar System demo created with central star and two planets in orbit. Both planets minor and major axis have the same ratio as the periapsis(minor) and apoapsis(major)
    of Mercury and Venus.
-> V0.02
    Snake demo added
-> V0.01
    Initial release with base program structure and rain demo
